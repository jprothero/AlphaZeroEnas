What if we had a neural network where inherently everything is a graph?

I.e. it accesses each of it's components based on a root to leaf tree structure

So for example we have an input, such as an image

Then we select a component with attention

So basically at each time step we choose the followup component

And what is the ultimate goal

We want to efficiently choose, and reuse components, to solve a given problem

So for example we want to be able to allow the network to dynamically create net components

And then chain together execution of those to get to the ultimate goal.

Now the question is how do we make that differentiable

We could use alpha zero as a strong reinforcement learning training algorithm

I dont think we can train "create or dont create" by making it differentiable

It would be a lot harder at least


So the idea would be basically to dynamically create
