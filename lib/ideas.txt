Can we incorporate the parameter sharing they use?
The issue is it locks the networks to be a certain size at the beginning
The obvious answer is maybe to have an upper bound on sizes, and 
then randomly take num_filters random slices from there,

but again it kind of locks the system into certain types of ops,

I doubt you can dynamically switch dilations or groups

Interesting trick that they use to combine different number of channels for num_filters
They concat them all on the depth dimension and they use a 1x1 conv to combine them
Very cool, with that maybe it's worth looking into sharing the computational graph again
